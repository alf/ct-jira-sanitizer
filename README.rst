Small app to compare hours logged in current time and in Jira
=============================================================

I might write some documentation for this if I get some free time
later.  Or you can do it for me.

Please note that this code is not well tested.  So if you want to make
use of it I recommend that you do some proper manual testing, or even
better; write some automatic tests.

This application depends on my ct api located here: https://github.com/alf/ct
